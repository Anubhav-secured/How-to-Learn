# Modes of learning
# Focus and diffuse modes of learning
understanding a little bit of some of the basics about how our brain works we can learn with more ease and less frustation.
# Types of thinking modes 
According to the research we have two different fundamental mode of thinking
1. Focussed mode  
2. Diffused mode 
# Focussed mode of thinking
Focussed mode of thinking is preety straightforward ->> its simply focussed.
We use focussed thinking whwn we are really concentrating on a matter at hand.
In the focussed thinking we concentrates carefully/intently on something that we are trying to learn.focussed thinking is highly attentive state of mind 
where the brain uses its best concentration ability in order to perform crtain task.
when we are in focussed mode of thinking its like we have one track mind for the matter at hand.Distraction doesn't exist in this mode of thinking.

# Diffused mode of thinking 
when our minds are free to wander we shift into a diffuse mode of thinking, sometimes it is called natural mode if thinking.
Diffuse thinking looks at the big picture.unlike focussed thinking diffuse thinking is all about distraction,
Diffuse thinking happens when we let our mind to move/wander freely and making connections at random,usually diffuse thinking happens ehen we do other things.
like focussed thinking diffused thinking are also very much important. somr of the example of diffused thinking are going for a run to take break from study
taking a deep breath while study.
One of the important benefits of diffused thinking is that when our consious mind is relaxed ,our brain is able to form a creative solution or 
finally link ideas that has been eluding us.
now as far as neuroscientist know right now we are either in focussed mode or diffused mode of thinking.
Its a kind of like a coin in which we can see either one side or another side of coin but not both sides at the same time.
So being in in mode seems to limits our access to other modes of thinking.
